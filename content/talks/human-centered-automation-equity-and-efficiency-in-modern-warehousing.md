Warehouse automation is reshaping global supply chains, delivering striking 
gains in efficiency—processing speeds up by 167%, order accuracy up 35%, and 
workplace injuries down 78.4%. Yet this transformation is not purely technical; 
it profoundly affects the people who keep logistics running. Drawing on findings
 from a multi‑country study across 57 distribution centers and 1,783 workers, 
this session explores the complex workforce impact behind automation. After 
deployment, headcount reductions averaged 38.4%, with entry‑level roles seeing 
displacement rates above 60%. Only 21.3% of displaced workers qualified for new 
technical roles, intensifying wage gaps as technical positions rose to 
$38.20/hour while manual wages stagnated.

For the Linux and open‑source community driving many of these systems, the 
challenge is designing automation that elevates rather than excludes. Case 
studies show that collaborative human‑robot systems can boost throughput by 
41.7% while reducing walking distance by 67.3%. Workforce training programs of 
160+ hours yielded $4.23 ROI per dollar and cut turnover by 58.4%. Regions 
coupling these initiatives with tiered benefits, tax incentives, and educational
 reforms achieved 41.7% higher career transition rates and 73.6% job placements 
within 120 days.

Join this talk to see how inclusive design, open innovation, and thoughtful 
policy can guide the next wave of warehouse automation toward sustainable, 
human‑centered growth.
