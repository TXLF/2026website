Why Pipelines?

Teams often struggle with inconsistent development workflows, siloed knowledge,
and reinventing the wheel.  But what if your team, (or even your entire
organization), could treat pipelines as a first-class service, encapsulating
best practices, promoting shared understanding, and enabling repeatable,
scalable development and/or operations flows?

In this workshop, we'll walk through how to build and offer "Pipelines as a
Service" to your team or organization.  We'll explore a development pattern
that helps individuals and teams adopt shared workflows without sacrificing
flexibility or autonomy.  By leveraging Git hooks, reusable GitLab CI
pipelines, and containerized helper tooling, you'll learn how to turn
institutional knowledge into a portable, maintainable, and discoverable
resource.

Starting with a template repository, participants will implement a custom Git
workflow that includes local pre-commit and pre-push hooks and multi-stage CI
jobsâ€”all tied together with clear documentation and intuitive entry points.
Whether yourre in DevOps, platform engineering, or internal tooling, this
workshop will show you how to scale your team's best practices through
automation and thoughtful defaults.
