As enterprises increasingly embrace real-time, high-volume, and schema-flexible 
workloads, the limitations of traditional relational databases become more 
apparent. NoSQL technologies ranging from key-value and document stores to 
columnar and graph databases have emerged as powerful solutions. But their 
adoption at scale comes with architectural, performance, and integration 
complexities that must be strategically addressed.

This session provides a pragmatic and performance-driven roadmap for 
implementing NoSQL systems in modern enterprise architectures. Attendees will 
explore how specific NoSQL data models align with real-world scenarios from 
sub-millisecond access patterns for session data, to high-throughput ingest for 
IoT telemetry, and millisecond graph traversals for fraud detection. We’ll 
compare key capabilities, such as document flexibility, columnar write speeds, 
and the impact of distributed design on scalability and fault tolerance.

We’ll also delve into integration challenges that arise in hybrid systems 
combining NoSQL with relational databases. These include synchronization 
overheads, increased latency from consistency trade-offs, and ETL/ELT pipeline 
complexity. For teams building cloud-native platforms, streaming analytics 
infrastructure, or microservices-driven architectures, these factors can add 
15–40% in performance drag if not properly mitigated.

By the end of this talk, Linux and open-source practitioners will be equipped 
with concrete evaluation frameworks and deployment strategies for NoSQL 
technologies, helping them modernize legacy stacks, design resilient data 
pipelines, and drive alignment between database architecture and evolving 
business demands.
