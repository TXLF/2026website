Ever wanted to build your own cloud but didn't think you have the time?  Ever
wanted to deploy OpenStack but didn't think you had the space?  Well, now you
can do it fast and small ... and embedded!

In this workshop we will get you on board the Rackspace OpenStack Flex cloud,
where you then build your OWN cloud on top.  We will spin up a
fully-functional, highly-available OpenStack cloud using Genestack â€“ the same
cloud software used in OpenStack flex - which uses Kubernetes, OVN, and
OpenStack together.  Your cloud will be fully-functional, with nested
hypervisors, working networking, and the ability to look not only at the
client-side APIs, but also to peek under the hood and see how it all works!

All you need is a laptop with internet access, and we will provide the rest!
If you don't have a laptop with you, or if you just want to join to just listen
and learn, that's cool too!  You are more than welcome.
