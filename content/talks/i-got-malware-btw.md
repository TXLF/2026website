Cyber attacks, specifically malware has been a recent headache for the Open 
Source world. Malware has increasingly been spotted in new areas of the FOSS 
supply chain. In many ways little has changed in our perception that Linux is 
immune. I think itâ€™s time we changed that. In this talks you will hear about the
 latest Malware in the Arch Linux User Repository (AUR). What the community and 
enterprises can do to protect themselves. And some ideas on what the FOSS 
community can help with fostering FOSS security.
