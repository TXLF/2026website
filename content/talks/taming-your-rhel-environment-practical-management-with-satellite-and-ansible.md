As a Solutions Architect at Red Hat, I work with organizations every day to
solve real-world infrastructure challenges—security, patching, lifecycle
management, and compliance.  This session will distill those experiences into
practical insights you can take home and apply immediately.

We'll explore:

* What RHEL system management looks like in 2026
* How Satellite fits into the picture for system provisioning, patching, and
  subscription management
* How Ansible can automate and simplify your day-to-day operations
* Where to start if you're new—and how to level up if you're already hands-on

Whether you're just getting started with Red Hat systems or looking to
streamline your environment, this session will give you the foundational
understanding and tools to manage RHEL with confidence.

No marketing fluff—just real-world use cases, demos, and proven strategies to
help you tame your fleet.
