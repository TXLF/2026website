Linux is ubiquitous! That means it runs on everything from phones we carry with
us everywhere, to large mainframe systems that sit in our data centers and
still drive the core of banking, airlines, and more. In this talk, I'll provide
a quick history of the 20+ years Linux has been running on mainframes to
provide context. From there I'll dig into the core of the talk with technical
details of how Linux is installed on the platform, and the interesting
hardware-driven features available to Linux via standard open source tools,
from default on-chip compression and decompression via gzip, to support on each
core for OpenSSL-driven cryptography. Plus, the latest processor has on-chip
AI/ML hardware features that have a fully open source inferencing pipeline on
Linux.

To conclude, I'll share resources from the Linux Foundation's Open Mainframe
Project that have allowed the Linux distributions to collaborate, and a series
of free tools and services provided by various organizations so open source
developers can easily port their own applications to the mainframe
architecture.
