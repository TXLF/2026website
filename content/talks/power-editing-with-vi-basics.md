This hands-on tutorial will take you from Vi beginner or intermediate user to a
power user, able to leap tall text buildings with a single bound.  Unleash the
full power of that blinking cursor, become more efficient at your job, and fame
and fortune will surely follow.  Most people use about 10% of what Vi is fully
capable of.  Awaken to your text editor's full potential.

Who Should Attend This Presentation?  Anybody that works on UNIX and Linux
systems would benefit from fully learning Vi, an ubiquitous and standard
editor.

Topics include:

* History and design principles
* The command language syntax
* All movement commands
* Many text alteration commands
* Working with registers ("clipboards")
* Working with multiple files
* Undoing and redoing changes
* An introduction to the Vim editor

This is a hands-on workshop.  Attendees should bring a laptop to follow along
with the in-class exercises.  Please download a copy of "Alice's Adventures in
Wonderland" from Project Gutenberg, which we will use to practice Vi motion,
editing, and text transformation commands.
