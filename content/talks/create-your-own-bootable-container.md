Have you heard of Atomic Desktops?  Immutable Distros?  Bluefin or Bazzite?
They're all based on this technology called Bootable Containers or "bootc" for
short.  Come learn how to create your own personalized computing experience
without the overhead of creating your own distro!

This workshop will walk you through creating your own bootable container,
installing applications into your image, managing updates, and how to put the
whole thing on autopilot!  At the end you will have a base image to start
customizing to your needs and know how to install it onto any system.
