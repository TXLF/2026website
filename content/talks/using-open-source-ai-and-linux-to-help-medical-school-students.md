One of the most challenging parts of AI adoption is finding trusted use cases.
Most people fall into three camps regarding AI: true believers, hard skeptics,
and the crucial "maybe" group, stuck in the middle.  The "maybes" aren't
against AIâ€”they just haven't seen a use case that clicks.

Through the open-source project PETE (Patient Engagement Training Experience),
I'll show you exactly how AI transforms medical education by creating realistic
patient interactions that would be impossible to replicate at scale otherwise.
PETE demonstrates how to build AI applications that enhance human capabilities
rather than compete with them.  By creating realistic patient simulation
scenarios for medical students learning motivational interviewing techniques,
this project showcases AI adoption that's both practical and ethical.

This talk offers more than just information; it's a roadmap for practical AI
integration and adoption.  I'll walk through the technical implementation using
Ollama and Django, but more importantly, the decision-making framework that led
to this use case.  You'll learn how to identify AI opportunities that build
trust rather than erode it, implement guardrails that matter, and create value
propositions that resonate with both technical teams and stakeholders.
