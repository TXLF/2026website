From plain-old Postgres to the LGTM stack, ELK, Cassandra, and ClickHouse, the
landscape of telemetry storage options is as vast as it is overwhelming.  With
so many choices, how do we decide which datastore is right for the job?  In
this talk, Joshua will guide attendees through the foundational principles of
telemetry—covering metrics, traces, logs, profiles, and wide events—and break
down the strengths and limitations of different database technologies for each
use case.  We'll examine how traditional relational databases like Postgres can
still hold their own, where ELK and CockroachDB fit into the picture, and why
specialized stacks like LGTM (Loki, Grafana, Tempo, Mimir) are so popular in
modern observability pipelines.  And, of course, we'll highlight the growing
role of ClickHouse as a versatile and high-performance option for logs, traces,
and more and VictoriaMetrics as a drop-in replacement for Prometheus.  By the
end of this session, attendees will have a clearer understanding of the
trade-offs between these datastores and how to make informed decisions based on
the unique requirements of their systems.  Whether you're building an
observability stack from scratch or looking to optimize an existing setup, this
tour of the observability datastore landscape will leave you better equipped to
navigate the options.
