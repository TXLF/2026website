High-Performance Computing can seem intimidating as it is full of buzzwords
like RDMA, SLURM, and InfiniBand.  But what if your first real job dropped you
into the thick of it?

Join me to learn from my experiences and what I would share for someone
breaking into HPC.

Starting your first job in tech can be overwhelming, and this feeling is even
more intense if you plan to work in complex fields like High-Performance
Computing.  In this talk, I'll share what it's like to step into the world of
HPC and the lessons I've learned along the way.  Whether you're a student, a
new hire, or simply curious about what it's like to work behind the scenes in
HPC, this talk offers valuable perspectives and stories from someone who's been
in your shoes.
