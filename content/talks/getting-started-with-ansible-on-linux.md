Ansible is an agentless, remote management tool for Linux, Windows, networking
equipment, and other systems.  In this session, Red Hat's Thomas Cameron will
introduce you to Ansible on Linux.  Thomas was initially pretty intimidated by
Ansible, because he was never a developer, and it SURE looked like coding.  But
now, he's a full time Ansible specialist at Red Hat.  He'll talk about how
Ansible works under the hood.  He'll discuss core ideas like control nodes,
managed nodes modules, and playbooks.  He'll walk you through installing
Ansible, and how to prepare your systems for management.  He'll show you how to
define an inventory of managed machines.  He'll teach you how to configure
Ansible for sessions and checks.  He'll talk you through ad-hoc Ansible plays,
and then introduce you to Ansible playbooks.  He'll teach you how to check your
playbooks for syntax, how to run them, and some tunables you should be aware
of.  Thomas will dive a little deeper into group variables, loops,
conditionals, tags, and selective runs.  You'll learn about roles, Ansible
Galaxy, the community repository of Ansible modules, and Ansible vault for
secret protection.  You'll learn about common gotchas and troubleshooting, then
wrap up with resources for you to reference after the talk.
