Curious about Valkey?  Come learn what this open-source fork of Redis is all
about: why it exists, how it works, and what it means for your real-time data
needs.  We'll cover where Valkey came from, what's familiar, what's new in 8.X,
and how to get started using it today.  Whether you're a Redis user, or just
Valkey-curious, you'll walk away knowing how Valkey keeps your data fast, your
ops simple, and your future open.
