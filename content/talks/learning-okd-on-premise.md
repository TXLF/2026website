In this session, Thomas Cameron will discuss how to learn OKD (the upstream
project from which Red Hat creates the OpenShift product) in your enterprise
lab or even in a homelab. When Thomas wanted to learn OKD/OpenShift, there were
a ton of cloud options, but trying to figure out how to do it on premises was
not trivial. This session will use nothing but zero cost Open Source software
from the OKD project, but it is applicable to the commercial Red Hat OpenShift
product, as well.

In this session, Thomas will go through what it takes from a hardware
perspective, how to set up OpenShift in virtual machines if you have the
capacity, how to set up things like storage and networking, how to install
software from Github as containers, and getting started with OKD.

He will go from bare metal (or new VMs) to a demonstration of a “production”
workload using WordPress and MariaDB.
