Cloud-native development has redefined the role of the developer—deployment is 
no longer a separate concern, but an integral part of the programming process. 
Whether targeting containers, Kubernetes, or serverless platforms, developers 
must think about infrastructure from day one.

Ballerina is an open-source language designed for this new paradigm. With 
built-in support for Docker, Kubernetes, and serverless deployment targets, 
Ballerina enables you to go from writing integration logic to deploying it in 
the cloud—all without leaving your development environment.

This session dives into the latest release, Ballerina Swan Lake, and its 
powerful cloud-native features. Learn how Ballerina generates deployment 
artifacts automatically, integrates with Kubernetes out-of-the-box, and 
simplifies the developer experience for building, deploying, and managing 
modern cloud applications.
