There have been several important changes to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux
(RHEL) ecosystem in the past few years. Many people don't fully understand
these changes, leading to confusion and even anger. Don't panic! Allow this
talk to be your guide for navigating these changes. The goal is to provide a
holistic overview of the RHEL software supply chain, including where Fedora and
CentOS fit in. This talk will explore a bit of distribution history,
upstream/downstream relationships, and the current state of the RHEL ecosystem.
