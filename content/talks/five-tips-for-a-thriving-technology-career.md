If you look behind every piece of technology, you find people. Relationships
with people, including those with coworkers, leaders, and direct reports, form
the foundation for every successful career. Triumphs and tragedies line my
career path I've learned some difficult lessons from many of them.

In this talk, I'll share five of my best tips for building a great technology
career, especially one in open source. Each one comes with at least one
hilarious or horrifying example. Attendees who want to dig deeper into certain
topics will find lots of references to books and blog posts in my slides.
