In the last year we saw the rise of AI systems like ChatGPT, Stable Diffusion,
Dall-E and others. Large Language Models like GPT are enabling a lot of new
innovative features and products which will revolutionise the world. But this
large autoregressive language models come with a lot of challenges that can
have negative effects on the Open Source and Open Tech community. For example
it's unclear if in the future everyone will have access to the same ML models
and training data. Can students, startups and open source people build
innovative new products using AI in the same way the open source communities
build Open Code and Open Tech. How can we make sure that the AI system are not
discriminating underrepresented minorities? What is the energy consumption and
CO2 emissions of this new big AI systems? This talk will discuss the current
challenges around AI. In the second half it covers the new innovative local and
open source AI features that the Nextcloud community is building. At the end
the talk looks into the new Ethical AI framework and what it means for existing
SaaS AI solutions and the open source local alternatives. It also covers the
ongoing discussion to define an Open Source AI definition in the OSI community.
