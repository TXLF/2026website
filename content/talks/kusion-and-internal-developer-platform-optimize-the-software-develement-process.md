With the rapid evolution of information technology, particularly the integration
 of new technologies and systems with cloud computing, the software development process has advanced significantly. This integration has resulted in 
enhancements in software quality and performance. However, the continuous 
introduction of new technologies and tools means that software engineers must 
continually acquire new skills, leading to potential delays in product launches 
and impacting business revenue.

In this talk, I will present the following issues:

* Introducing Kusion first-ever open-source project which included in both the 
CNCF SandBox and the Platform Tooling Landscape: An intent-driven Platform 
Orchestrator, that sits at the core of an Internal Developer Platform (IDP). 
With Kusion you can enable app-centric development, your developers only need to
 write a single application specification. It helps app developers who are 
responsible for creating applications and the platform engineers responsible for
 maintaining the infrastructure the applications run on.

* Internal Developer Platform (IDP) building solution to optimize the software 
development process with Cloud Native/Platform tools and integrate with cloud 
resources of all cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) with Kusion (Platform 
Orchestrator)
