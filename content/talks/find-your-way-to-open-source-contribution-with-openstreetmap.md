OpenStreetMaps endeavor is to map the physical world as it exists. This means
anything the user deems important, can be added so long as it actually exists.
OSM is a map of the world, created by people like you and free to use under an
open license and provides an open API for anyone to query. This means OSM is
used by anyone who wants or needs a map. Need a map to guide you to an address?
OSM has addresses. Need an app that provides safe walking paths at night? OSM
has data on which sidewalks are lit. Need an app to plan a bike ride and need
to know what the road surface is? OSM provides road surface. These are only a
small selection of resources that are used daily on OSM. Regular and frequent
local contributions are greatly needed. Fortunately, getting started with OSM
is both easy and fun. This presentation is aimed at those who want to
contribute to an Open Source project, but don't know where to start. It
requires no technical skills to begin and this presentation will help you with
everything you need to start. This talk will cover the main OSM website,
StreetComplete, the iD editor, and a brief introduction to JOSM.
