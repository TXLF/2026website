Kubernetes is the backbone of modern application deployment, but its networking
 demands have outgrown traditional Ingress. This talk introduces the Kubernetes 
Gateway API—a robust, future-ready standard—and NGINX Gateway Fabric, its 
powerful implementation. We’ll examine Ingress’s constraints and then highlight 
Gateway API’s strengths: multi-protocol support, precise traffic management, 
and extensibility for complex scenarios like cross-namespace routing and service
 mesh integration. Through practical use cases, we’ll demonstrate how NGINX 
Gateway Fabric enhances performance and flexibility. We’ll also address the 
coexistence of Ingress and Gateway API, offering guidance on adoption and 
monitoring. Join us in understanding this shift and preparing for Kubernetes 
networking’s next chapter.
