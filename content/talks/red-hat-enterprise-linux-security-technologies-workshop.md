In this workshop you will learn about two, of the many, security-related
features included in Red Hat Enterprise Linux: Terminal Session Recording and
System-wide Cryptography Policy. Both of these features were introduced in Red
Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and offer new capabilities to system administrators for
auditing and configuring the encryption cyphers offered to applications running
on the machine. Attendees must bring their laptop for this session. Lab
materials are provided.
