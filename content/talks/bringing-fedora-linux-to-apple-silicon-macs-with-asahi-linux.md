In 2020, Apple introduced the M1 ARM SoC, and the world changed! Well, not
exactly… But it did change the world for Macs, as this began the era of
ARM-based Mac computers using Apple's own CPU designs. These so-called "Apple
Silicon Macs" can't run Linux… or can't they?

With tight collaboration with the Asahi Linux project, the Fedora Asahi SIG
have produced the Fedora Asahi Remix to allow people to run Fedora Linux on
these new Macs. This presentation introduces the Fedora Asahi SIG and discusses
the journey to supporting Fedora Linux for these new Macs.
