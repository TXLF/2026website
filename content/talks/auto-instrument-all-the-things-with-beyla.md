Observability is essential, but adding it shouldn't mean rewriting your entire
application.  In this talk, we'll explore how Beyla, an open-source
auto-instrumentation tool built by the Grafana Labs team and recently donated
to the OpenTelemery Project leverages eBPF to provide zero-code, low-overhead
observability for your services.

Whether you're working with Go, Java, or other languages, Beyla enables you to
trace HTTP/gRPC traffic and export OpenTelemetry-compatible data all without
touching your codebase.  We'll dive into how Beyla works under the hood, what
use cases it's best suited for, and how to get it running in minutes.

Expect a live demo, lessons learned from real-world adoption, and a practical
look at how Beyla fits into modern Linux-based observability stacks.  If you're
ready to "auto-instrument all the things" and reduce friction between
developers and observability teams, this session is for you.
