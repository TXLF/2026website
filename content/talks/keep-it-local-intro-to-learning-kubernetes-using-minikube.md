Starting out, learning Kubernetes was daunting. Do I need three or more
high-end machines? Do I need to run it all on the cloud to test anything? These
are some of the questions you may be asking yourself before starting your
learning journey. These were definitely the questions I was asking myself.

One of the biggest jumps up the learning curve was realizing I could use tools
like Minikube to run a local Kubernetes cluster to test out applications or
work through simple how-to tutorials.

In this workshop, we will fast-track your learning journey by setting up
Kubernetes locally with minikube, highlighting potential pitfalls and
limitations, and deploying a simple test app so you can see it all from start
to end.

What I want you to walk away with:

- Understand what Minikube is and how it fits into the Kubernetes ecosystem.
- Learn how to install, configure, and start a local Kubernetes cluster using Minikube.
- Learn how to deploy and manage workloads locally.
- Understand limitations of using Minikube vs deploying in production.

This talk is for:

- Sysadmins / DevOps Engineers looking to broaden their skillset
- Enthusiasts and Students looking to jump into something new
