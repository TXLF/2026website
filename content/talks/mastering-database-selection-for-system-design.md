A database's architecture shapes its performance for specific tasks.  This
session explains why Relational databases, with rigid schemas excel for
structured, transactional workloads; NoSQL systems, using document or key-value
models, prioritize flexibility and scale; NewSQL blends SQL standards with
distributed systems for high-concurrency environments but sacrifices latency;
and data warehouses leverage columnar storage for massive analytical queries
yet struggle with live applications.  We cover how key architectural components
like data storage structure, distributed node processing, transactional models,
and CAP theorem trade-offsâ€”introduce benefits and trade-offs, revealing why
each database suits certain use cases but not others.  You'll gain a practical
framework to evaluate any open-source database for Linux systems, enabling
confident, informed selections.
