Take all of the documentation and throw it into the database and we’re done
with AI, right? Not so fast.

Large language models (LLMs) don’t know everything and retrieval-augmented
generation, or RAG, fills in the knowledge gaps with just-in-time retrieval of
data from a database. Technical limitations and challenges loom large here, but
there are plenty of difficulties brought over from the world of humans into the
world of LLMs.

Come on a RAG journey with me as I recount some of the roadblocks my team faced
as we built a product with RAG as a core component. Learn about the available
technologies, how to build out a RAG stack, and how to avoid bringing human
complexity into an already complex technical system.
