WebAssembly is garnering a lot of excitement because of it's unique combination
of portability, performance, security, and cross-language support. We're seeing
it used widely across browser, server-side, and IoT use cases. WebAssembly is
also seeing adoption from major companies. But what actually is WebAssembly?
This talk will crack open the hood of WebAssembly and help demystify what is
going on inside at a beginner friendly level.

The core of the talk will focus on understanding what a WebAssembly module is,
how it is executed, and how you compile code into WebAssembly. We'll explore
the text and binary representations of a module; the data layout within a
module; and understand the basics of how its bytecode instructions operate a
stack machine.

Then with an understanding of how WebAssembly works we'll spend some time
briefly learning about the WebAssembly component model. Finally we'll finish
with a demo of why WebAssembly is a great alternative to containers.
