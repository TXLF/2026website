In this hands-on workshop we explore how WSL works (WSL1 → WSL2 → WSLg), when
to choose it vs VMs or pure containers, and how to build a fast, reproducible
dev setup on Windows with a complete Linux toolset.  We'll install and tune
WSL, run services with systemd, launch GUI apps, wire up Docker Desktop's WSL
backend, and package/import a custom WSL distro you can share with teammates.
We close with a live demo of a production-style loop (Rider/VS Code, FAKE,
dotnet, Docker Compose, Beyond Compare, Claude Code) running from WSL.
Attendees leave with a working setup, a cheat sheet, and the confidence to make
WSL their daily driver.

* Audience: Devs/SREs/IT who use Windows but want Linux tooling.
* Prereqs: Terminal basics; Windows 11 preferred (Windows 10 supported);
  virtualization enabled; local admin.
* Hands-on: BYO laptop recommended; instructor backup lab VMs available;
  offline assets provided.
