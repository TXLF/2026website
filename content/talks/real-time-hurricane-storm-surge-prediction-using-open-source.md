The **ADCIRC Surge Guidance System (ASGS)**, first formally discussed in 2008,
is a portable real-time operational storm surge forecasting framework.  It has
continued to be refined with each Atlantic hurricane season since then.  ASGS
has delivered critical, time-sensitive information to emergency managers at the
federal, state, and local levels in Louisiana, Texas, and North Carolina, as
well as to agencies such as FEMA, NOAA, and DHS.  Over the years, it has saved
millions of dollars in time, property, and emergency assetsâ€”and likely many
lives.

This talk traces its origins as a collaboration between LSU and UNC in the wake
of Hurricane Katrina (2005), through its first real test during Hurricane
Gustav (2008), and up to the modern day, where ASGS has consistently supported
communities.  It also covers technical aspects of the system: the ADCIRC finite
element coastal ocean model at its core, how the user experience has been
tailored for real-time operations, and the technical decisions that have
enabled ASGS to become a robust, adaptable framework for operational use.

Currently, ASGS supports local and national emergency response in Texas and
Louisiana.  It runs on computing resources provided by the University of Texas'
Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC), the LSU High Performance Computing
Center, and the Louisiana Optical Network Initiative (LONI).  Most relevant for
this audience, the talk highlights how the use of Perl, Bash shell scripting,
standard Unix tools, and a whole host of open source software has made all of
this possible.
