Container-optimized Linux distributions have been around for a while but the
concept is not widely understood and even less widely adopted.  Additionally,
there are a plethora of options in this space that fragment and obscure the
shared benefits that span the category.  Ultimately, container optimized Linux
distros tend to provide some real quality of life, security, and/or efficiency
advantages for those operating Kubernetes clusters.

In this talk, you will learn the differences between general purpose Linux
distros and specialized distributions and further dive into Linux distributions
specifically optimized for hosting container workloads.  Attention will be paid
to why the concept of a special, optimized Linux distribution makes
particularly good sense for the basis of Kubernetes nodes.  Additionally, a
cohort of open source container optimized Linux distros will be examined
(including Talos, Flatcar, and Bottlerocket) with dives into the components of
each distro, how they are similar, and different from one another and what
primary use cases they address.  Finally, the presentation will conclude with
the scenarios where using a container optimized Linux distro doesn't make
sense.
