We're in the midst of an AI revolution—and APIs are its unsung heroes.  While
LLMs and AI agents grab headlines, it's APIs that power their ability.  Behind
every AI-generated insight, recommendation, or automated task is an API call
connecting the model to the tools, services, and data it needs to get the job
done.

As AI systems evolve from passive assistants to autonomous agents capable of
decision-making and execution, APIs have become the essential infrastructure
enabling this transformation.  They are no longer just integration tools—they
are the action layer of AI.

In this talk, we'll explore how APIs are shaping the future of intelligent
automation.  Using real-world examples from across industries, we'll examine
how companies are leveraging APIs to orchestrate multi-step workflows, access
real-time data, and drive operational efficiency with AI.  Organizations with
robust, scalable, and discoverable API ecosystems will not only keep up—they'll
lead. If AI is the recipe, APIs are the ingredients.  It's time we start
treating them that way.

What You'll Learn:

- The shift from human-first to machine-first consumption patterns in API
  design
- Emerging standards that are streamlining AI-API interactions
- Strategies to future-proof your API ecosystem for the intelligent systems of
  tomorrow
