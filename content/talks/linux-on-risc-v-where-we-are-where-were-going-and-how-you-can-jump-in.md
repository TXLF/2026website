Readily available RISC-V Single Board Computers are here!  But much like the
Arm SBC ecosystem, most don't have a great "out of the box" experience.  We are
not yet at the point where you can just download the installer ISO from the
usual places and put it on your shiny new board.  This doesn't mean the distro
you want doesn't work, so let's talk about how you can do to get your favorite
distro installed.  How about graphics? Can I drop a GPU into these systems and
get those sweet sweet EGL powered pixels? In some cases: yes, so let's talk
about that and what the challenges are.  Then there is Upstream Support.  What
does that mean? Why is it so slow? What is a vendor kernel and why should I
care? Lots of answers to that as well.  This is a big overview of what's going
on, where to find info, a showcase of what works, and an invitation to get
involved.  Lots of resources will be shared, places to go to get help, and what
pitfalls to be aware of.  We're going to focus on the Banana PI BPI-F3, Orange
PI RV2, MilkV Jupiter, MilkV Megrez, SiFive HiFive P550 Premier, and StarFive
VisionFive 2 boards.  It's going to be a lot of fun, and I hope to see you
there.
