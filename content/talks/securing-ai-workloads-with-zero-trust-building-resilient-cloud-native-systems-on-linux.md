The intersection of artificial intelligence and Linux-based infrastructure has
created unprecedented opportunities—and equally significant security
challenges.  As AI workloads increasingly dominate enterprise computing,
traditional security models built around network perimeters have proven
inadequate for protecting these dynamic, distributed systems.  This
presentation explores the implementation of Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)
specifically designed for AI workloads running on Linux platforms.  We'll
examine how the "never trust, always verify" principle applies to machine
learning pipelines, containerized AI services, and distributed training
environments.  Through real-world case studies and practical demonstrations,
attendees will learn how to architect secure AI systems that maintain
performance while drastically reducing attack surfaces.  Key topics include
securing AI model serving with dynamic authentication, implementing
microsegmentation for ML pipelines, protecting sensitive training data through
fine-grained access controls, and leveraging Linux-native security features
like SELinux and cgroups within a Zero Trust framework.  We'll also cover
emerging threats specific to AI systems—including model poisoning, adversarial
attacks, and data exfiltration—and demonstrate how ZTA principles can mitigate
these risks.  Attendees will leave with practical knowledge of open-source
tools, architectural patterns, and implementation strategies for building more
secure AI infrastructure on Linux.  Whether you're deploying machine learning
models in production or building the next generation of AI-powered
applications, this session will provide actionable insights for strengthening
your security posture without sacrificing innovation.  Suitable for system
administrators, DevOps engineers, security professionals, and developers
working with AI/ML systems on Linux platforms.
