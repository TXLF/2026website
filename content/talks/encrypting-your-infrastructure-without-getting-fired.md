Join us as we explore Tang & Clevis, a suite of Open Source tools that
automagically decrypt Linux boot volumes without escrow or requiring black
magic TPM configurations.  These tools are useful for protecting data-at-rest
in edge installations, servers in data centers, on premise or in clouds.  We'll
explore the state of data-at-rest encryption, the ways its commonly done and
their pitfalls, and the pros and cons of Tang and Clevis along with a
high-level investigation of its more advanced configurations, alternatives
involving TPM2 and if the stars align properly, a live demo with physical
props.
