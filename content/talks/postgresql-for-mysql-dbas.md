At a high level, one relational database is pretty much as same as another.
There are a lot of similarities between the two most popular open-source
databases. Learning a new database is not that difficult but sometimes you need
a little guidance, such as this workshop. If you feel you are fairly competent
with MySQL and either want to learn a new database for your own development
purposes or are just curious why so many feel PostgreSQL is superior, then keep
reading.

This workshop will cover the main differences between MySQL and PostgreSQL in
a) setup, b) backup/restore, ). account administration, d) replication, and e)
indexes. Plus you will see some of the truly interesting features found in
PostgreSQL that are not found in MySQL. Please bring a laptop loaded with
PostgreSQL 15 or 16 or just follow along with the notes.
