In this session you'll learn about Valkey, a new Linux Foundation open source
alternative to the Redis project from both a technical and project perspective.
First, the session will cover what triggered the creation of the project and
what it aims to achieve.  Then, gain insight into what the software does, how
you can move to Valkey, and see a short overview of it's capabilities through a
demo.  Finally, you'll find out how you can get involved with the project.
