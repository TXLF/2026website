Starting my career in the pre-virtualization era, I'll admit containers passed
me by at first. There was much to learn and work on in the bare-metal space,
and containers were not a focus for some time. Containers have undeniably
impacted the industry, and my learning journey started at square one. This
session will begin with the perspective of a systems administrator who needs to
understand the role containers can play in an environment. We'll touch on a
wide array of topics:

- Linux technologies that make containers happen
- Different container runtimes
- Container networking
- Container storage
- Multi-container management
- Building a custom container

The attendee will gain an understanding of container topics that go beyond what
a container is and focus on how containers integrate into an environment.
