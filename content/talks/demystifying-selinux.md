Demystifying SELinux aims to break down the perceived complexity of SELinux and
show how it can be a powerful, yet manageable tool for securing your systems.

We'll begin by briefly tracing the history of SELinux and uncovering how it
operates at a fundamental level.  From there, we'll explore the core components
that make up SELinux and explain how each piece contributes to system security.
You'll learn about key concepts like policies, contexts, and booleans, and how
they work together to safeguard your environment.

Next, we'll dive into practical applications, demonstrating how to use the
SELinux toolset to enforce security on your systems.  You'll see real-world
examples where SELinux enhances security, mitigates risk, and helps ensure that
your systems stay protected from misconfigurations and potential threats.

By the end of the session, you'll walk away with answers to these key
questions:

* Why should you secure your system with SELinux?
* How can you easily secure your system using SELinux, even if you're new to
  it?
* What tools and techniques can you use to make SELinux work effectively for
  you?

This session will give you the confidence to leverage SELinux and secure your
systems with less effort and more effectiveness than you might have imagined.
