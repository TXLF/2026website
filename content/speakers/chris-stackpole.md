Stack was first introduced to Linux in the late 90's. His love of Linux and
High Performance Clusters began in college where he converted to all Linux, all
the time as his OS of choice. He has now been a Linux HPC Admin for twenty
years and has been involved in many Open Source projects during that time for
both pleasure and work. Stack is pleased to have been a regular TLXF attender
since the beginning and occasional presenter. He is currently the Rocky Linux
Testing Team lead who enjoys walking the uncommon path and documenting it in
OpenStreetMaps.
