I'm a Senior System Software Engineer at Cloudflare, with extensive experience
across the Linux systems stack.  My background includes managing teams focused
on Linux-based network products (Cloudflare), developing Linux kernel syscall
tracing (Confluera), and leading system software development (Vectra Networks).
I also served as a Kernel Engineer and technical lead for Canonical's Linux
livepatch service, and started my career with Linux bringup on PowerPC systems
at IBM.
