Willard is a distributed systems hacker by day, network administrator by night.
With a strong background in devops, they prefer to immerse themself in every
level of the software and hardware stack.  As a Software Engineer II at
Datadog, they work on the platform that ingests and serves metadata for
millions of hosts.  In their free time, they volunteer for NYC Mesh, a
non-profit community network dedicated to extending reliable internet to all
New Yorkers, installing networking equipment and writing software to help
administer the mesh.  They are an avid reader of science fiction, and enjoy
distance running as a way to connect with nature.
