Wes is a Seattle-based software engineer focused on open source, functional
programming, and building systems you can reason about.  On Linux Unplugged, he
covers everything from kernel internals like eBPF to container tech and modern
filesystems.  Lately, he's pairing NixOS with mesh networking to build secure,
declarative infrastructure.  When he's not podcasting or coding, he's out
hiking with his dog, Charlie.
