Currently providing technical evangelism for NGINX, Dave works with DevOps, 
developers and architects to understand the advantages of modern microservice 
architectures and orchestration to solve large-scale distributed systems 
challenges, especially with open source and its innovation. Dave has been a 
champion for open systems and open source from the early days of Linux, through
 open distributed file systems like XFS, GFS, and GlusterFS to todayâ€™s world of 
clouds and containers. He often speaks on topics such as the real-world issues 
associated with emerging software architectures and practices, on open source 
software and on creating new technology companies.
