My name is Matthew (not Matt).  I've been with Percona for 16 years, and have
been working with MySQL for 10 years before that.  I've held positions at
Rackspace, Dell, PayPal, and Ebay.  As Principal MySQL Architect at Percona,
I've helped customers who process one of the credit cards in your wallet,
handle your healthcare insurance claims, and ensure your recent ATM deposit was
properly accounted.  And speaking of One Direction... well.. just watch this :-)
