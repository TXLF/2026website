Hello, my name is Sophia!  With a background in Biochemistry from UT Austin, I
discovered a passion for coding in the DIY Diagnostics lab, where wet lab
research and software development went hand in hand.  After graduating in 2021,
I began my career at GM as a Deployment Engineer/Analyst, later transitioning
into a Software Engineering role observing real-time LLM based robotic systems
on the plant floor.  Now, as a Developer Advocate at Elastic, I draw on my
experience optimizing and troubleshooting logs, traces, and metrics in
high-stakes, in-plant production environments.  I bring both technical depth
and practical insight to the challenges of observability at scale.
