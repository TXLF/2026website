Matt has been involved with all things Security, Open Source and Linux since
before they were cool.  He's worked with everything from Fortune 50's and Wall
Street Fintech firms to a tropical fish wholesaler.  When not working tech,
hiking or bicycling, he enjoys geeking out with symphonies, prog rock, jazz,
bluegrass and whatever else tickles his melodic, harmonic and rhythmic fancy,
because it don't mean a thing if it ain't got that certain je ne sais quoi.
Matt holds CISSP & CISA certifications and is currently serving as the
President of the Austin chapter of the Information Systems Security
Association.
