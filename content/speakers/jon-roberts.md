Jon has over 25 years of experience in software development working in
environments as diverse as embedded systems up to big iron systems running AIX,
z/OS.  From Windows and DOS to iSeries (AS400) and HP3000 minis.  He has
experience with a variety of database systems, programming language paradigms,
and different development methodologies.  When he's not developing software
he's hanging with his two miniature schnauzers or tinkering on his â€˜69 Ranchero
in San Antonio, TX.
