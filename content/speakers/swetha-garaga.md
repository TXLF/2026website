Swetha Garaga is a highly experienced Senior Software Engineer with a strong 
track record of developing and delivering enterprise-grade applications across 
multiple domains. With over ten years of hands-on experience, she has worked 
extensively with Java/J2EE technologies, specializing in full-stack development,
 microservices architecture, and RESTful API integration. Swetha has played a 
critical role in building and customizing large-scale systems such as 
point-of-sale (POS) platforms for retailers like Dollar General and Shoppers 
Drug Mart, as well as warehouse automation solutions powered by robotic 
integration. 

Her technical toolkit includes Java, Kotlin, Spring Boot, Hibernate, Angular, 
and TypeScript, along with robust experience in build and deployment tools like 
Jenkins, Docker, Gradle, and Bitbucket Pipelines. She brings deep expertise in 
UI development, service-oriented architecture (SOA), backend automation, and 
database management using SQL Server, DB2, and MongoDB. Swetha is also 
proficient in test automation using tools such as Selenium, JUnit, Mockito, 
Cypress, and Concordion. She is recognized as a Subject Matter Expert in card 
payment systems, loyalty integration, and back-office applications, often 
serving as the go-to engineer for mission-critical components. Her contributions
 span the entire software development life cycle (SDLC), from requirements 
gathering and system design to implementation, testing, and deployment within 
Agile (SCRUM) environments. 

In addition to her engineering credentials, Swetha is passionate about 
mentorship and innovation in education. While at Northern Illinois University, 
she contributed to STEM outreach programs as a mentor for Motorola’s Enhancing 
Engineering Pathways (NIU-EEP) initiative, guiding middle school students in 
engineering-focused projects. She also conducted research on nanomaterials and 
signal processing, including work with electrochemical etching and FPGA-based 
modulation techniques during her academic and internship tenures. Swetha’s 
career reflects a rare blend of technical mastery, leadership, and a strong 
commitment to both innovation and collaboration, making her a valuable asset in 
any forward-looking technology team.
