I’m a Developer Advocate at CloudBees and co-host of the DevOps Paradox podcast, 
spending my days figuring out how to make complicated DevOps stuff actually work for real teams. 
I got into this field because I love the challenge of taking complex technical concepts 
and breaking them down into something useful – whether that’s through conversations on the podcast, 
speaking at events, or just talking with developers 
who are trying to ship code without losing their minds. 
What really drives me is the human side of all this technology; 
I’ve seen too many DevOps initiatives fail not because the tools were bad, 
but because nobody thought about how people actually work together.
