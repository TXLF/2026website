Eduardo Robles works for County of Hidalgo IT department as a Cybersecurity 
Analyst IV. A Linux nerd interested in Information Security, Cyber Security, 
Open Source, tacos, and coffee. Emacs is my way of life and Screen is my serial
 console of choice. Youâ€™ll probably catch me burning music to my Sony Minidisc 
or using Emacs for hacking.
