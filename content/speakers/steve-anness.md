Steve Anness is a Senior Customer Success Architect @ Grafana Labs, where he
works with end users daily on their observability tooling.  Passionate about
eBPF and auto-instrumentation, Steve plays a key role in advancing efforts like
Beyla, empowering organizations to gain observability with zero code changes.

Steve has spent the better part of two decades helping organizations get the
most out of open-source tools.  Prior to joining Grafana Labs, Steve spent
nearly 13 years at Zenoss in various technical and leadership roles, helping
clients navigate deep infrastructure monitoring and complex projects.

Steve holds an AAS in Computer Networking & Systems Administration from Texas
State Technical College and is a certified Kubernetes and Cloud Native
Associate based in Austin, TX.  He brings a wealth of knowledge around
observability.

When he's not configuring dashboards or troubleshooting eBPF instrumentation,
you'll find him geeking out with ham radio, taking care of his 3 and half year
old daughter or playing with different distributions of Linux in his home lab.
