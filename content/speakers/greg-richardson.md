I'm a Solutions Architect at Red Hat, where I help organizations design and
implement scalable, open-source solutions using technologies like Red Hat
Enterprise Linux, Satellite, Ansible Automation Platform, and OpenShift.  With
a background that spans engineering, support, and sales, I've had the
opportunity to work across multiple layers of IT—from hands-on systems work to
high-level strategy.

My passion for Linux started early and has shaped much of my career.  I love
the power and flexibility that open-source tools offer, and I'm constantly
exploring new ways to optimize, automate, and secure infrastructure using Red
Hat technologies.

Outside of work, I'm an avid gamer and PC hardware enthusiast.  I spend a lot
of my free time building custom rigs, tuning performance, and testing
open-source tools in gaming environments—because yes, Linux can be an awesome
gaming platform when configured right.  Whether it's tweaking system configs
for better frame rates or running game servers on RHEL, I genuinely enjoy
pushing Linux in ways that are both practical and fun.

At the end of the day, my goal is to make complex systems more manageable,
scalable, and approachable—especially for teams just starting out with Red Hat
tools.  I love sharing what I've learned and helping others get the most out of
their Linux environments.
