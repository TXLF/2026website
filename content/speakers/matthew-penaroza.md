I'm a Principal Solutions Engineer at TiDB, where I help enterprises design
scalable, cost-efficient database architectures.  I've worked closely with
engineering teams at many multi-billion dollars companies to architect
distributed data solutions that support mission-critical, high-scale workloads.
I specialize in helping teams simplify complex data architectures, unify
operational and analytical workloads, and scale.
