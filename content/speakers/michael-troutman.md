Michael Troutman works as a documentation specialist at LINBIT, an HA, SDS, and
DR open source software company.  In the spirit of the open source community in
which LINBIT thrives, Michael works to help the LINBIT team document its
software and its many uses so that it can be widely understood and used.
Michael has an extensive background working in systems administration,
networking, and technical support, and has worked with Linux since the early
2000s.  Michael's interest in writing goes back to an avid reading-filled
childhood.  Somewhere he still keeps a publisher's rejection letter from a
choose-your-own-adventure style novella, written when he was 10, set in the
world of a then-popular science fiction role-playing game.
