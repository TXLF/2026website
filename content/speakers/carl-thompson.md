I am Carl "Redragon" Thompson.

I began my adventures at an early age on a TI-99/4A that was on display at the
department store where my mother worked.  I remember working all summer with my
father to save up the money to buy my own.  I was inseparable from that machine
for a very long time.  I took computer classes in high school (COBOL and RPG
II) feeding my desire to learn more about computers.  In the early 90s I played
with Linux in it's youth and my first commercial installation was with Red Hat
5.2 converting a local BBS into an ISP.  I finally turned it into a full time
career in the late 90's.

I have held over 14 certifications with Red Hat and became a Red Hat Certified
Instructor in 2014.

I have worked my way through being an administrator, engineer, and now
architect.  During my work history I have taken every possible moment to share
my knowledge with others.  In my roles over the last two decades I have been a
pillar for supporting coworkers with any issues they couldn't resolve on their
own.

By day I architect solutions to ensure software is highly available and secure.
My last 7 years at Apple soley focused on Security, High Availability, and
Automation.

The nick name comes from me being referred to as the Red Dragon but unix had an
8 character user limit so when I created my first unix account it was redragon
and has stayed with me over the 30 years.
