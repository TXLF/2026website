I've been in the Information Technology field for over 15 years, cutting my
teeth on Novell Netware 3.x and DOS/Windows 95/98/2000 and later administering
Novell Netware 6+, AIX, Linux, and Windows server systems.  For the last nine
years I've been employed at Rackspace Hosting in San Antonio, Texas, and am
currently a Principal Architect focused on cloud networking and support for the
Rackspace Private Cloud product based on OpenStack.
