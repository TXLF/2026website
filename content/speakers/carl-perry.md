Carl is a RISC-V Ambassador, organizer of the Austin RISC-V Group, but that's
his night job.  By day he does various boring stuff for a big company around
DevOps/SRE and compliance.  He really likes talking about (and being involved
with the development and adoption of) RISC-V, I hope that came across.  He's
also been involved with the Austin community for over twenty years, and would
love to say hello to you.
